# CorrMCNN_Arch2

Implementation of our paper - *[Common Representation Learning Using Step-based Correlation Multi-Modal CNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00003.pdf)* presented as spot-light paper in **Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition (ACPR-2017).**

This file contains the code for CorrMCNN (2<sup>nd</sup> architecture). The 7<sup>th</sup> loss variables can be removed to obtain the 1<sup>st</sup> architecture. Furthermore, dropout and batch normalization layers have been removed in the above version of code, which can be added by the viewer.
